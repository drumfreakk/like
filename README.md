# Like/Dislike
A like/dislike counter for websites in javascript, php and mysql

Put everything in this layout on a webserver (i.e. an apache server), then make install/makedb.sh executable and execute.
It will ask you for the root password of mysql, and then it will add a user and database for the like/dislike button.
Once you have run makedb.sh, you can remove the folder install

If you want, then in sql/run.sh will remove all the likes/dislikes.

The main index.html can be integrated into another page, as long as it is still in the same position and the content of the paragrafs and dividers are left the same.
